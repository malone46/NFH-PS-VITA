# Neighbours From Hell for PS VITA
This port is based on the free **1.1.5** version of Neighbours From Hell.

**NOTE**: All **Season 1** levels are unlocked. Season 2 levels are disabled as they are missing from the game files. Social buttons have been disabled because they caused crashes.

# Setting up
For the best experience, I recommend enabling overclocking to reduce stutters as much as possible.

Known Issues:
- Text can glitch and need to be refreshed by hovering buttons or just reloading the menu.
- There is some stutters that lower the framerate with the camera.

Have fun !

# Neighbours From Hell for PS VITA
This port is based on the free **1.1.5** version of Neighbours From Hell.

**NOTE**: All **Season 1** levels are unlocked. Season 2 levels are disabled as they are missing from the game files. Social buttons have been disabled because they caused crashes.

# Setting up
For the best experience, I recommend enabling overclocking to reduce stutters as much as possible.

# Patching
- Download Neighbours From Hell VPK from VitaDB/Github and install it.
- Go to the Release page and download ```NeighboursFromHellANDROID.zip```.
- Extract it.
- Put the ```.xapk``` inside the extracted folder and name it ```NFH(.xapk)```.
- Launch ```ApplyPatch.bat``` and wait (Can take several minutes depending on your system).
- Let it finish and there should be a .ZIP file named ```NFH_FILES.zip```.
- Open VitaShell, connect your PS Vita to your PC and copy the contents of the .ZIP file (Not the ZIP file itself, just files inside it) over to ```ux0:app/HELL12345/``` (Picture Below of how it should look after copying everything).
